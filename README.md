Use Visual Studio 2022. Make sure to install the "Desktop development with C++" workload when installing.
- If you have trouble building, you may need to install the "C++ ATL for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)" and/or the "C++ MFC for latest 143 build tools" option in the "Individual components" section of the installer.

To get running:
- Check out code.
- Open `quake2.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Set the `quake2` project as the startup project.
- Build and debug the project. Use the debug solution configuration.
